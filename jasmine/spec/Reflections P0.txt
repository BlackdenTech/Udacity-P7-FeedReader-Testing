Reflections P0

I am a Systems Engineer by trade for a Healthcare IT Company. My day job is to troubleshoot, maintain, and occasionally automate sections of a Java-based web application used by hospitals and medical centers around the globe. I also do consulting work on the side for small businesses and personal clients, several of which have asked me if I can build and maintain websites. I wanted to take this course for two reasons: First, to help me understand what is going on behind the scenes with the application I support. (My background is in Windows/Linux administration, not development) Second, I wanted to add a skillset to my portfolio to better support my consulting clients. In the field of technology, the day you are not willing to learn and adapt to a new technology is the day you will be surpassed by someone who is.
